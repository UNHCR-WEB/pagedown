\title{UNHCR ggplot2 theme for maps with big labels for powerpoints}
\usage{
unhcr_style_map_big()
}
\description{
Return ggplot2 styling for maps with big labels for
powerpoints / slides.

R's default settings for plots are designed to make them legible when viewed
on a monitor that is less than half a metre away. When viewed on a TV screen
from several metres away, these settings make the axis labels and other text
too small to read.
For presentations, the base font size should be 18 to 24 points, depending
upon the size of the TV and how far away people are sitting.
