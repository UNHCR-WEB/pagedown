# About


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

Please, review the below:

* Having a specific title will help avoid having someone browse posts and only finding vague, similar sounding titles
* Setting the reader's context with a motivation section makes someone understand how to judge your choices
* Visualizations that can stand alone, via legends, labels, and captions are more understandable and powerful



## Include table



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
